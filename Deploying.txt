Deploying the GAN to a cloud-based service procedure:

To get an image generation service going, we need to pick a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. 
Then, we build an API using Flask, stash our model in the cloud, and create an endpoint for generating images. 
If we want, we can use serverless options to deploy it easily. Clear documentation helps users, and the cloud takes care of scaling as needed. 
Just be mindful of costs as you proceed. This practical approach simplifies image generation, making it efficient and budget-friendly.
